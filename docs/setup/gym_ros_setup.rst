Overview
--------

This page provides the steps required to set up the gym_ros simulator environment for RoboRacer. It will use Docker and foxglove to keep the setup process similar over different OSes.

Requirements
------------

 - As Docker is being used, this setup is OS agnostic. It should work on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. The specs of the devices should not need to be too powerful to run the simulator. A modern laptop with 8GB of RAM and a quad-core CPU should be sufficient.
 - Go to foxglove.dev and create an account. You will need to log in to foxglove studio to view the gym_ros environment.

Windows setup
-------------

Here is the setup video to follow along with, or you can just follow along with the text commands. Note that some commands may take longer to resolve than in the video the first time you run them:

   </div>

1️⃣ **Install Docker**

We will start by downloading Docker Desktop and getting it running. You can download Docker Desktop from the official website: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

There are a few videos online that can help with the Docker installation process. Here's one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMx4ydYKCHw

Sign into the docker app, using any account is fine. Github or google accounts are the most convenient to use.

*Important Note:* Things may not work starting from step 3 in the Windows section if you do not run the Docker Desktop app before running the commands in step 3. Make sure to run the Docker Desktop app first, every time you start your computer and want to run the simulator.

2️⃣ **Repo Setup**

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the repository to be cloned to. For my example, I will use ``C:\Users\Student\Documents>``

Once you're in the desired directory, run the following commands in the terminal to clone the repo and enter its directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros.git
   cd f1tenth_gym_ros

You should now see your new directory path. For example, ``C:\Users\Student\Documents\f1tenth_gym_ros>``.
We will now swap to the dev-humble branch of the repository. Run the following commands in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout dev-humble
   git status

You should see that you are now on the dev-humble branch.

3️⃣ **Finish docker setup in terminal**

If you haven't run the Docker Desktop app since the last time you booted your PC, start it, then run the command once it's up:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker compose up -d --build

It may take a few minutes, but the end of the command's output should look something like this:

.. code-block:: text

	✔ Image f1tenth_gym_ros               Built				2.2s
	✔ Container f1tenth_gym_ros-sim-1     Started    	    4.0s

.. note::
	You will have to run this command every time you start your computer, otherwise the docker won't be running and the following steps won't work.

If you see the proper output, you can now enter the docker container by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker exec -it f1tenth_gym_ros-sim-1 /bin/bash

Now, instead of a filepath like ``C:\Users\Student\Documents\f1tenth_gym_ros>``, you should see a filepath like ``root@(numbers and letters):/sim_ws#``.

To ensure that you're on the correct branch once more, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo $ROS_DISTRO
   ls /opt/ros

4️⃣ **Launch the gym_ros environment**

Both of those command should return "humble". If not, use the command "exit" and swap to the dev-humble branch, then follow the steps from that point again. Then, continue with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py open_foxglove:=false

You'll see more lines of output, eventually stopping with something like

.. code-block:: text

   Advertising new channel ## for topic "/cmd_vel"

If that's what you see last, you're good to open your browser and go to this link, keeping the terminal open:

.. code-block:: text

   https://app.foxglove.dev/?ds=foxglove-websocket&ds.url=ws://localhost:8765

If prompted by your browser to allow foxglove to interact with other apps, click "Allow". You should see a page that says "foxglove studio" and prompts you to sign in. Sign in with the account you created earlier.

The sim should now be running in your browser. Go to the ``Simulator Window Setup`` section of this page to find the steps to ensure the sim windows are set up properly.

Linux setup
-----------

Here is the setup video to follow along with, or you can just follow along with the text commands. Note that some commands may take longer to resolve than in the video the first time you run them:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
      <iframe
         width="600"
         height="315"
         src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5A3BQrK6tI?si=aC71iZm06El4Qzb3"
         title="Linux gym_ros setup video"
         frameborder="0"
         allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
         allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>
   </div>

1️⃣ **Install Docker**

We will begin by installing Docker. To ensure that no older version of Docker are installed that may interfere with getting the sim running, we will start by removing any older versions of Docker. If at any point your terminal asks if you'd like to continue with Y/N, answer Y. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt remove docker.io docker-doc docker-compose podman-docker containerd runc

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install lsb-release

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
   sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

The command above may not work on the school wifi network, so if not, try a different one. Then continue:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null 

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

Finish the installation by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Once you run that, log out of your computer and log back in. You can verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run hello-world

If you see a message that says "Hello from Docker!", then Docker is installed correctly. If not, try restarting your computer instead of just logging out, then running the last command again.

2️⃣ **Install git and Set Up the Repo**

Next we'll get git running and set up the repo. Run the following commands in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install git

Before running the next command, navigate to the directory where you want the repository to be cloned to.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros.git

.. code-block:: bash

   cd f1tenth_gym_ros

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout dev-humble

.. code-block:: bash

   git status

You should now be on the dev-humble branch in the repo's new directory. This is very important, so if git status returns a different branch, make sure you get swapped before continuing.

3️⃣ **Finish docker setup in terminal**

If you're on dev-humble, run these commands to finish setting up the docker container:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker compose up -d --build

.. note::

	You will have to run this command every time you start your computer, otherwise the docker won't be running and the following steps won't work.

The output of that command should end with text that looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

  ✔ Image f1tenth_gym_ros               Built		    2.2s
  ✔ Container f1tenth_gym_ros-sim-1     Started    	    4.0s

Once that's finished, run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker exec -it f1tenth_gym_ros-sim-1 /bin/bash
   echo $ROS_DISTRO
   ls /opt/ros

After the first command above, your filepath should change to something like ``root@(numbers and letters):/sim_ws#``. The second and third commands should both return "humble". If not, use the command "exit" and swap to the dev-humble branch, then follow the steps from step 3 again.

4️⃣ **Launch the gym_ros environment**

Continue with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py open_foxglove:=false

The output of that command should end with text that looks like this:

.. code-block:: text

   Advertising new channel ## for topic "/cmd_vel"

If the above is what you see last, you're good to open your browser and go to this link, keeping the terminal open:

.. code-block:: text

   https://app.foxglove.dev/?ds=foxglove-websocket&ds.url=ws://localhost:8765

The sim should appear as running. If foxglove asks you to allow it to do stuff, do so. Go to the ``Simulator Window Setup`` section of this page to find the steps to ensure the sim windows are set up properly.

MacOS setup
-----------


Simulator Window Setup
-----------------------

This section will show you how to set up the simulator windows so that they are easy to view and use. The steps are the same for all OSes.

Some notes:

- I haven't actually used this simulator, and do not know how it's supposed to function. This will get you set up with the bare minimum view windows, but you may need to edit it further once you actually start using the sim.
- The windows may be set up as desired upon initial setup (they were for me on Windows), but even so, ensure all of the settings are the same for each view window.
- In order to get the settings for a view window on the left side, click on the view window you wish to see them for.
- The first set of settings looked at in the video is the 3D view window.
- The two windows on the right have the same name, but their variables in the series tab at the bottom of their settings are slightly different. The top window's series are named as /cmd_vel.linear.(x,y,z), whilst the bottom window's series are /cmd_vel.angular.(x,y,z) (linear vs angular). Make sure to select the correct one for each window.
- If you do not have the 2 windows on the right and the 2 on the bottom, I show how to add/duplicate them in the video using the Split option. Then you must select the correct window type by clicking the 3 dots on the top right of the window, then click Change Panel, then select the one that matches its position in the video for each one.
- If you have no bottom view windows at the beginning, make an additional copy of the right window, then drag it out and snap it to the bottom like how you would a browser/other application window, then duplicate it to the side (also shown in the video).
